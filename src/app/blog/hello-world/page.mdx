# Hello, SaavyLab

Welcome to the SaavyLab blog. We’ll share build notes from our products (like Staaf), experiments in music technology, and open-source updates.

What to expect:

- Short, practical write-ups from day-to-day development
- Architecture choices for a cross-platform music app
- Small libraries and utilities we extract and open source

Thanks for reading — say hi at [jayson@saavylab.com](mailto:jayson@saavylab.com).
